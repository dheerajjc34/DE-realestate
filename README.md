# Real Estate Project

This repository contains a data engineering project focused on real estate datasets, processed using a data pipeline that includes Databricks, Azure Logic Apps, and Power BI.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to analyze real estate data to generate insights using cloud-based tools and technologies. The main steps in the project are:

1. **Resources**:
   - The necessary resources for this project are organized and uploaded to the repository.

2. **Databricks Pipeline**:
   - A data pipeline was developed in Databricks to handle the data processing tasks.

3. **Pipeline Execution**:
   - The pipeline was executed to process the real estate data.

4. **Data Management**:
   - Both raw and processed data were managed and stored for analysis.

5. **Azure Logic App**:
   - Azure Logic App was used for orchestrating certain automated tasks within the pipeline.

6. **Web Activity in Pipeline**:
   - The pipeline includes web activities that interact with external services.

7. **Databricks Notebook**:
   - The Databricks notebook contains all the code for processing the data.

8. **Emails from Pipeline**:
   - The pipeline was configured to send emails upon completion or failure of specific tasks.

9. **Power BI Dashboard**:
   - Power BI was used to create a dashboard that visualizes insights from the processed real estate data.

## Tools and Technologies Used

- **Databricks**: For developing and running the data processing pipeline.
- **Azure Logic Apps**: For orchestrating and automating processes within the pipeline.
- **Power BI**: For creating dashboards and visualizing the data.


## Results

The Power BI dashboard provides insights into the real estate market, showing trends, property values, and other key metrics.
